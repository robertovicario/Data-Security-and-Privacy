# Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

_Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)_ is a security model that assigns permissions to users based on their roles within an organization. In RBAC, users are assigned to roles, and each role has specific permissions associated with it. This model simplifies access management by grouping users into roles, making it easier to manage permissions at scale.

## Key Components

| **Component** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Users | Individuals or entities that access the system. |
| Roles | Named groups of permissions that can be assigned to users. Roles represent job functions or responsibilities within the organization. |
| Permissions | Specific access rights to perform actions on resources. Permissions are associated with roles rather than individual users. |
| Sessions | Temporary associations between users and roles. A user can activate a role during a session to perform specific tasks. |

## Role Hierarchy

> **Definition:** _Role hierarchy_ is a feature of RBAC that allows roles to inherit permissions from other roles. This simplifies permission management by allowing administrators to define a hierarchy of roles, where higher-level roles inherit permissions from lower-level roles.

More formally, a _role hierarchy_ can be mathematically formalized as a partial order $RH \subseteq ROLES \times ROLES$ on the set of roles $ROLES$. The partial order is denoted by the dominance relation $\geq$:

- When $r_1 \geq r_2$, we say that $r_1$ is _senior_ to $r_2$, and $r_2$ is _junior_ to $r_1$.

### Semantic Role Inheritance

| **Semantic** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| User Inheritance | All users authorized for a role $r$ are also authorized for any role $r'$ where $r \geq r'$. |
| Permission Inheritance | A role $r$ is authorized for all permissions for which any role $r'$, such that $r \geq r'$, is authorized. |

## Separation of Duties (SoD)

> **Definition:** _Separation of Duties (SoD)_ is a security principle that divides responsibilities among multiple users to prevent fraud and errors. It ensures that no single user has complete control over a critical process, reducing the risk of unauthorized actions.

### Types of SoD

| **Type** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Static | Conflicts are resolved during system design. |
| Dynamic | Conflicts are resolved at runtime based on user actions. |

# SQL Access Control

_SQL access control_ is a mechanism used to manage and restrict access to database resources based on user roles and permissions. It ensures that only authorized users can perform specific actions on the database, such as querying, updating, or deleting data.

## SQL Injection

_SQL injection_ is a code injection technique that exploits vulnerabilities in an application's software by injecting malicious SQL code into a query. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, data manipulation, or even complete control over the database.

> **Example:** Consider a web application that allows users to log in using their username and password. The application constructs a SQL query to authenticate users:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ? AND password = ?;
```

If the application does not properly validate or sanitize user input, an attacker could inject malicious SQL code into the username or password fields. For example, if the attacker enters the following input for the username:

```sql
' OR 1 = 1; --
```

The resulting SQL query would be:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '' OR 1 = 1; --' AND password = ?;
```

This query would always return true, allowing the attacker to bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access to the application.

### SQL Injection Types

| Type | Description |
|-|-|
| Classic | The attacker injects malicious SQL code into a query, allowing them to manipulate the database. This can include bypassing authentication, retrieving sensitive data, or modifying data. |
| Union-based | Combines results from multiple queries using the `UNION` operator to extract data from other tables. |
| Time-based | Exploits response delays to infer database information by observing query execution time. |
| Blind | Exploits application behavior to infer database information without direct feedback. |

### Mitigation Techniques

| Technique | Description |
|-|-|
| Parameterized Queries | Use prepared statements to ensure user input is treated as data, not code. |
| Input Validation | Ensure user input is sanitized and conforms to expected formats to prevent malicious code execution. |
| Least Privilege | Grant only the necessary privileges to users and applications. Avoid using admin accounts for routine tasks. |
| WAFs | Use Web Application Firewalls to detect and block SQL injection attempts. |
| ORM Frameworks | Use Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) frameworks to simplify database interactions and mitigate SQL injection risks. |
