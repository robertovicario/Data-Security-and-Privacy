# EU Legislations

The concept of _privacy_ in the European Union emerged with Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (1950), which affirms the right to respect for private and family life. Any interference by public authorities must be lawful and necessary in a democratic society.

## Data Protection Directive (1995)

> **Definition:** _Directive 95/46/CE_ was introduced in 1995 to regulate the processing of personal data across EU member states.

- Enforced in national laws by 1998 (e.g., Italy: 1996).
- Emphasized **ownership of personal data** by individuals, not by data controllers.

### Key Concepts

| **Term** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Personal Data | Any information that identifies an individual. |
| Sensitive Data | Includes health, political opinions, religious beliefs, etc. |
| Consent | Required for data processing and disclosure. |
| Purpose Limitation | Data must only be used for stated purposes. |
| Data Subject Rights | Individuals can access and correct their data. |

## Italian Data Protection Code

> **Enacted:** _January 1, 2004_ — unified existing privacy regulations.

- **Art. 1**: Recognizes the right to personal data protection.
- **Art. 2**: Requires that processing respects freedoms and dignity.
- Introduced the principle of **Data Minimization**: use anonymous data when possible.

## General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)

> **Effective Date:** _May 25, 2018_ (Approved: April 14, 2016)

- Applies to any entity processing EU citizens' data, regardless of location.
- Replaced previous directive and harmonized EU-wide data protection.

### Core Principles

|-|-|
| Lawfulness, Fairness & Transparency | Processing must be clear and legal. |
| Purpose Limitation | Data collected for specific purposes only. |
| Data Minimization | Only necessary data should be processed. |

### Key Roles

| Rectification | Correct inaccurate or incomplete data. |
| Erasure ("Right to be Forgotten") | Request deletion under specific conditions. |
| Portability | Transfer data to another service. |
| Restriction & Objection | Limit or oppose certain processing activities. |

### Transparency & Consent

- Consent must be **freely given**, **specific**, **informed**, and **unambiguous**.
- Controllers/processors must inform data subjects clearly about processing activities.

### Privacy by Design & Default

> Organizations must integrate data protection into system design and default settings.

### Data Protection Officer (DPO)

- Required for:
  - Public authorities.
  - Entities conducting large-scale monitoring.
  - Processors of sensitive data.

| **DPO Responsibilities** |

- Both **controllers** and **processors** are liable.

# US Legislations

Unlike the EU, the U.S. lacks a centralized privacy framework. Instead, laws are **sector-specific** and **fragmented**.

## Key Federal Laws

| Law | Scope |
|-|-|
| HIPAA | Protects medical information. |
| COPPA | Regulates data collection from children under 13. |
| GLBA | Requires financial institutions to disclose privacy practices. |
| Privacy Act | Governs data held by federal agencies. |
| FOIA | Allows public access to federal agency records, with exceptions. |

- **Private sector data** is typically regulated through **contracts and privacy policies**.

## EU–US Data Transfer Frameworks

### Safe Harbor (2000–2015)

> Allowed U.S. companies to self-certify compliance with EU data standards.

| **Principles** |
|-|
| Notice |
| Choice |
| Onward Transfer |
| Security |
| Data Integrity |
| Access |
| Enforcement |

- Invalidated in **2015** by the Court of Justice of the EU (CJEU) due to U.S. surveillance concerns.

### Privacy Shield (2016–2020)

> Replaced Safe Harbor; aimed to restore trust in transatlantic data flows.

- Also invalidated in **July 2020** (Schrems II decision).
- Main concerns: lack of protections against U.S. intelligence access (e.g., FISA, CLOUD Act).

### Data Privacy Framework (DPF)

> **Announced:** March 2022 — **Effective:** July 2023

- Restricts U.S. government data access to what is **necessary** and **proportionate**.
- Introduces an **independent redress mechanism** for EU citizens.
